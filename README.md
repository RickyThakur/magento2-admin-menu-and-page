# magento2-admin-menu-and-page
This module is useful for beginners only, As this contents:
1. Creation of a Module
2. Registration of a Module
3. Creation of Menu for admin sidebar
4. Define route for url and layout xml name (As it follows Magento 2 naming conveniton)
5. Creation of PHTML page for admin page

The best part of this example module is, I provided labels for the important keyword which creates confusion when a beginner start to create module like route name, module name, menu id and menu action.

As I found difficulties when I decided to give a name to routes and menus, I followed examples form internet( Top searches in magneto 2 tutorials ).
